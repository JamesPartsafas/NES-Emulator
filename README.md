# NES-Emulator
An emulator for the NES (6502) system. To build the project, clone it in Visual Studio 2019 and run the build command. An output created by the Pixel Game Engine should be drawn to the screen, with the tests being run by default.

All NES opcodes and drawing functions are implemented in this project in their respective components. A subset of available cartridge mappers have been implemented. For more information on implementation details, refer to the Docs folder or visit the [NESDev Wiki.](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki)
